# Scenario: 
The user logsin to, or creates, their account with the program. They would fill in name and which category they fall under:
a-Alumni
b-Current Students
c-Non-Students
d-Children of a, b, or c
They then would receive the discount available and how much the ticket would cost. Then They can select the number of tickets they want to purchase and which categories each belongs to. Then they confirm the amount and types of tickets are correct, and input payment information. They receive an order confirmation and number.
